# Neural Networks - CS50AI Lecture 5

Biological neural networks are a system in the human body that consist of three stages: receptors, a neural network, and effectors. The receptors receive the stimuli either internally or from the external world, then pass the information into the neurons in a form of electrical impulses.

## Artificial Neural Networks:

- Mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. It works by mapping inputs to outputs based on the structure and parameters of the network.
- Allows for learning the network's parameters based on data.

To model this in our computer, we'll use something known as a unit. Units can connect to each other in different ways to solve a problem.
